## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In this analysis, we explore the 'Udemy Courses Dataset' to gain insights into the courses offered on the Udemy platform. We examine various aspects of the dataset to understand the subjects, course counts, pricing, and other relevant information.

## Dataset Overview <a name="dataset-overview"></a>

We start by loading the dataset and examining its structure. The dataset contains information such as course ID, title, pricing, number of subscribers, reviews, lectures, difficulty level, duration, and subject. We analyze the dataset using the Pandas library to perform exploratory data analysis.

## Subjects Offered <a name="subjects-offered"></a>

We identify the unique subjects for which Udemy offers courses. By examining the 'subject' column in the dataset, we determine the different subjects covered by the courses. This helps us understand the breadth of subjects available on the platform.

## Course Count by Subject <a name="course-count-by-subject"></a>

We determine the subject with the maximum number of courses. By counting the occurrences of each subject in the dataset, we identify the subject that has the highest number of courses. This provides insights into the popularity of different subjects among Udemy users.

## Free Courses <a name="free-courses"></a>

We identify the subjects that offer free courses. By filtering the dataset based on the 'is_paid' column, we isolate the courses that are available for free. This analysis helps us understand the subjects where users have access to a significant number of free courses.

## Paid Courses <a name="paid-courses"></a>

We examine the courses that are paid. By filtering the dataset based on the 'is_paid' column, we identify the courses that require payment. This analysis provides insights into the subjects where users need to pay for course access.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

In this analysis, we have explored the 'Udemy Courses Dataset' to gain insights into the courses offered on the Udemy platform. By examining the subjects, course counts, and pricing information, we have obtained valuable information about the dataset. This analysis can be further expanded and customized based on specific research or business requirements.
